* Goal

Want to share how I configure tmux (using Nix). I hope it can give you some ideas about how to potentially improve your workflow



* Aspirations

- [[https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/tmux][thoughtbot tmux course by Chris Toomey]]
- [[https://waylonwalker.com/tmux-nav-2021/][waylonwalker's blog]]

* Chirs Toomey course is great! but beware it is little bit outdated


** ~display-popup~

** ~display-menu~

* Mouse or no mouse
maybe you think the point of tmux is to do mouse-free workflow, to enable mouse in tmux

* oh-my-zsh tmux plugin

I am using ~zsh~ and ~oh-my-zsh~, it has a [[https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/tmux/tmux.plugin.zsh][tmux]] plugin.

* integrate with ~z~ like tool to autojump and start a new tmux session
#+begin_src shell
function zt {
    z $1 && tat
}
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src shell
function zt {
    z $1 && td --start
}
#+end_src

~zt~ cannot jump back to an existing session

* Put (almost) everything in one nix module
