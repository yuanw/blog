# introduction 

setup multiple java runtime for jdlts and eglot.

one would assume this is easy. But i did have to find lots trial and error.

```
              eglot = {
                enable = false;
                config = ''
                  (setq eglot-autoshutdown t)
                  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs
                  '((java-mode java-ts-mode) .

                  ("jdtls-with-lombok"
                  :initializationOptions
                      (:settings
                            (:java
                             (:configuration
                             (:runtimes [(:name "JavaSE-17" :path "${pkgs.jdk17.home}")
                                         (:name "JavaSE-21" :path "${pkgs.jdk21.home}" :default t)
                                       ]))))
                    )
                    )
                  ((go-mode go-dot-mod-mode go-dot-work-mode go-ts-mode go-mod-ts-mode)
                  . ("${pkgs.gopls}/bin/gopls"))
                  )
                '';
              };
```
