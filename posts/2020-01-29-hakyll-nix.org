* Why
So I have been learning nix, and want to write down my experinces.
* Setup
** Install nix
** [[https://all-hies.cachix.org/][enable all-hies cachix]]
* Boostrap the project
#+begin_src sh
nix-shell -p haskellPackages.hakyll
hakyll-init <siteName>
cd <siteName>
nix-shell -p cabal2nix # unless you already installed cabal2nix
cabal2nix . > default.nix
#+end_src
